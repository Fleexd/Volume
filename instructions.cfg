1. Import Cmdlet to PowerShell

Download https://github.com/frgnca/AudioDeviceCmdlets/releases/download/v3.0/AudioDeviceCmdlets.dll

Run the following commands in powershell with admin rights

	New-Item "$($profile | split-path)\Modules\AudioDeviceCmdlets" -Type directory -Force
	
-------------> Add the location of the dll file here
	Copy-Item "C:\Temp\AudioDeviceCmdlets.dll" "$($profile | split-path)\Modules\AudioDeviceCmdlets\AudioDeviceCmdlets.dll"

2. Run the kiwi.ps1 with powershell on admin rights.

	.\kiwi.ps1
	
3. Open index.txt

On your desktop Kimberly(nickname: Kiwi) created index.txt with the list of all audio devices.

Search for the Index number corresponding to the speaker and microphone

4. Edit Felix

Right click the felix.ps1 file and edit. Now a new window is opened: Powershell ISE, it is just a simple editor.

Configure the felix file, edit the <string> to the index number Kiwi gave you, two times, for speakers and microphone.

Also edit the -To "email@here.fi" to the email address that corresponds with the local admin.

Then find <hus> <rum>, change these to House name and room number.

Error reports will be sent directly to the local admin. The local admin will be notified and he will be fixing the problem shortly.


Selfservice

If you have some knowledge in prior powershell or programming experience the error report should be easy to dig through. 
Here we have an example on how the error report could look like.

	Index   : 1
	Default : True
	Type    : Playback
	Name    : Speakers (4- High Definition Audio Device)

In this error we see that the operator of the computer has not replaced the <string> with the corresponding index number
 with the speakers that should be used.
